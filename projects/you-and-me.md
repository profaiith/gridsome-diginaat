# You and me.

You met me when still was just a lost boy drowning in a sea of blood. You showed me on the way up. Who I need to be more socially acceptable! But was I accepted for I or was it sex that made it worth it.

## Did you love it?

It felt like your mission was to save me! You did. But were there times that you felt loved or was it just time to wasted when we both were lost in drugs?

even if I am extremely socially awkward. Farewell Stinky
